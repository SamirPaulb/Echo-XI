#PyAudio; sys.platform != 'win32'
#PyAudioWPatch; sys.platform == 'win32'      #This is a fork of pyaudio that support WASAPI loopback devices, so you can use an output as an input.
#So as it turns out, vosk can only recognize input from single-channel sources. In addition, WASAPI loopback devices seem unable to use any number of channels
#that isn't the maximum, so I had to scrap this whole idea. You'll need to rely on something like VBCable if you want to use an audio output as input.
